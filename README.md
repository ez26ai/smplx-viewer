# SMPL-X Viewer

An interactive, browser-based viewer for the **SMPL-X** parametric human body model.
Load your own SMPL-X model file and explore how the body changes as you adjust
**shape**, **pose**, and **facial expression** parameters in real time — all computed
client-side, nothing is uploaded anywhere.

![tech: React + TypeScript + three.js] · dark "lab instrument" UI · runs fully offline once the model is loaded

## What it does

- **Shape (β)** — 16 shape coefficients that morph height, weight, and proportions.
- **Pose (θ)** — global orientation plus per-joint X/Y/Z rotations for the spine, head,
  arms, and legs, driven through the full linear-blend-skinning kinematic chain.
- **Hands** — aggregate finger-curl controls per hand, plus a "relaxed hands" toggle
  that applies the model's mean hand pose.
- **Expression (ψ)** — 10 facial-expression coefficients (when the loaded model
  includes an expression space).
- **Presets** — Neutral, Relaxed, Wave, Sit, T-pose.
- **Display** — wireframe, skeleton overlay, mesh opacity, camera recenter, and a
  "pose blend shapes" toggle to trade anatomical accuracy for faster dragging.

The forward pass (shape + expression blend shapes → joint regression → Rodrigues
rotations → pose blend shapes → kinematic chain → linear blend skinning) mirrors the
semantics of the reference `smplx` Python library.

## Getting the model file

The SMPL-X model weights are **licensed by Max Planck and cannot be redistributed**,
so they are not included here. To use the viewer:

1. Register and accept the license at **https://smpl-x.is.tue.mpg.de**.
2. Download the SMPL-X models and locate **`SMPLX_NEUTRAL.npz`**
   (the `.npz` format, not the `.pkl`).
3. Open the viewer and **drag the `.npz` file onto the loader** (or click to browse).
   Parsing happens entirely in your browser — the file never leaves your machine.

> Only SMPL-X model files (10,475 vertices, 55 joints) are supported — not SMPL or SMPL+H.

## Run locally

Requires Node 18+ and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io).

```bash
cd main
pnpm install
pnpm dev        # start the dev server with hot reload (your edits show instantly)
pnpm build      # type-check + production build into dist/ (multi-file, for hosting)
```

Then open the printed local URL and load your `.npz`. While developing, `pnpm dev`
is the loop you want — every save is reflected in the browser immediately, no rebuild.

### Single-file build

To regenerate the standalone, self-contained page after changing the source:

```bash
pnpm bundle
```

This produces **`smplx-viewer.html`** in the project root — all JS and CSS inlined into
one file you can open directly in a browser or hand to someone, no server needed.
(Fonts load from Google Fonts when online; everything else is inlined.)

`smplx-viewer.html` is a build artifact, not linked to the source — rerun `pnpm bundle`
whenever you want to refresh it.

## Notes & limitations

- **Finger curl is a simplified aggregate control.** Real SMPL-X has 15 articulated
  joints per hand; this UI exposes a single curl per hand (about each finger's primary
  axis) plus the mean-hand toggle, rather than 90 individual finger sliders.
- **Pose blend shapes** are the most expensive part of the forward pass. If dragging
  feels heavy on a low-power device, turn them off in the **View** tab — the body will
  still pose correctly, just without the corrective deformations.
- Computation runs on the main thread, coalesced to one recompute per animation frame.
- The coordinate convention is Y-up with the camera looking from +Z.

## License

The application code here is yours to use freely. The **SMPL-X model itself is governed
by its own license** (https://smpl-x.is.tue.mpg.de) — review and comply with those terms.
